f = (1/Ld)*√(T/πδ)

where

    f is the frequency in hertz (Hz) or cycles per second
    L is the length of the wire in centimeters (cm)
    d is the diameter of the wire in cm
    T is the tension on the wire in gm-cm/s²
    π is the Greek letter pi = 3.14
    δ is the density of the wire in gm/cm³ (Greek letter small delta)
    √(T/πδ) is the square root of T divided by πδ

the density of steel wire is 7.8 gm/cm³.

f / (1/Ld) = sqrt(T/πδ)

(f / (1/Ld))^2 = T/πδ

((f / (1/Ld))^2) * πδ = T

Solve for tension

You can rearrange the equation to solve for the tension:

    T = πf²L²d²δ

Thus, if you know the other factors, you can find the tension on the wire.

T = pi * f^2 * L^2 * d^2 * density
